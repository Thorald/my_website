This study was conducted throughout the start of 2026. 
Out of interest, I recorded the phone usage of 100 individuals on the S-train.  
The recordings were primarily made on lines E and A, from Lyngby to Fisketorvet station.

Three different categories where chosen to be recorded. 
These include: **[looking at phone], [listening on headphones/earbuds], [talking on phone/headphones]** and **[not interracting with electronnics]**

Before reading the rest of this study you might try guessing what the results will be!

Here is an image of the recorded data:

    style={{

  />

As can be seen from the data above, **55%** of people who entered the train stared at their phone until exiting the train. **19%** listened to audio on their devices. **6%** held conversations on their phones. Lastly, **20%** did not use their phone at all.
