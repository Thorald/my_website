This is my **first website** 🎉

I made this website using [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [React](https://react.dev/). 

I have learned how to make links:
link to [home page](/)

This was written using [Markdown!](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

All blogposts are written in markdown and different "subsites" are generated with dynamic routing using a [slug!](https://stoutewebsolutions.com/what-is-a-slug-in-web-design/)

<Image
  src="/images/slug.jpg"
  alt="picture of slug"
  width={540}
  height={350}
/>

<p style={{ opacity: 0.7, fontSize: 14, textAlign: "center" }}>
  <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
  >
    slug
  </a>
</p>
